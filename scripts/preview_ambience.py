"""Render the drive ambience to a wav, so it can be auditioned and tuned
without starting CARLA.

    python scripts/preview_ambience.py --out ambience.wav

The point is the tuning loop. The constants in src/drive/ambience.py
(ROAD_LAYERS levels and exponents, ENGINE_* , GEAR_TOP_KMH) are hand-balanced by
ear, and doing that through a CARLA launch each time is minutes per iteration
for a five-second judgement. This renders a scripted drive -- idle, pull away
through the gears, cruise, slow to a stop -- in about a second.

It shares mix_levels() and engine_blend() with the live path rather than
reimplementing the curves, so what comes out of the wav IS the mix a participant
hears. Only the playback differs: pygame crossfades channels in real time, this
sums numpy arrays block by block.

Nothing here is used at run time; the drive does not import it.

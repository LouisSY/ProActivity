# Sweep the amount of per-driver training data used to fine-tune the xLSTM head
# and plot validation accuracy vs. number of training segments.
#
# For every prefix size k (chronologically first k segments outside the held-out
# validation tail) a fresh copy of the population head is fine-tuned with the
# L2-SP penalty and evaluated on the SAME validation tail, giving the
# "personalization quality vs. data collection time" learning curve.
#
# The frozen backbone runs exactly once: all segments are embedded up front and
# every sweep point trains a Linear(64->5) on the cached embeddings (full-batch,
# deterministic — no seed variance).
#
# The adaptation itself lives in ProVoice.models.head_adapt, which fine_tune_XLSTM
# also calls, so the curve measures exactly the procedure that gets served. Two
# properties of that module are what make points on this curve comparable to each
# other: the step budget does not depend on k, and the anchor is specified as a
# prior PRECISION tau (lambda = tau/2k) so its strength does not either. See the
# head_adapt docstring — both used to drift with k, in opposite directions.
#

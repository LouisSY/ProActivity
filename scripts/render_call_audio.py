"""Render the call event's spoken lines to .wav, once, offline.

    uv run python scripts/render_call_audio.py
    uv run python scripts/render_call_audio.py --engine sapi --list-voices

WHY OFFLINE
-----------
pygame cannot synthesise speech -- ``pygame.mixer`` plays audio, nothing more.
So the lines are rendered HERE, by hand, and the .wav files are what ship. That
also makes the audio deterministic: byte-identical in every condition, block and
participant, which a study needs and a live synthesiser cannot promise.

ENGINES
-------
``piper``  (default) local neural TTS, ``pip install piper-tts``. Voices are
           ONNX files under ``models/piper``, fetched with
           ``python -m piper.download_voices NAME --data-dir models/piper``.
``sapi``   pyttsx3 / Windows SAPI5. Kept as a fallback, but UNRELIABLE for batch
           work: on this machine it hangs after the second file, with or without
           a fresh engine per line, exactly as pyttsx3's reputation and the
           comment in src/drive/simcall_simulation.py suggest. It also has only
           two voices installed, both female, so the caller ends up sounding
           like the assistant.

LICENSING
---------
Piper the ENGINE is GPL (it embeds espeak-ng). That governs the software, not
its output -- rendering wavs with it and shipping them is fine. The question
that does matter is the VOICE MODEL's licence, which is per-voice: check the
model card for whichever voice ships with the study, and record it in
assets/calls/manifest.json alongside the icon credits.

VOICE
-----
Assistant: a female en-US voice, the convention for in-car assistants.
Caller: a DIFFERENT voice, deliberately male by default -- with one voice the
driver hears the assistant announce the call and then answer itself, which
undercuts the whole "it acted on your behalf" framing at LoA 3 and 4.

THE VOICE LANGUAGE MUST MATCH THE PARTICIPANTS AND THE ON-SCREEN TEXT. The panel
is written in English; if the study runs in another language, both move together.

# The wording deliberately mirrors the genuine set clause for clause -- lead

# PROPOSAL and not in how much the assistant says. A longer or more elaborate
# spam line would make salience, not autonomy, the thing that changed.
#
# It leads with the assessment rather than the caller because there is no
# caller name to lead with: the display shows a number, and reading a number
# aloud would be both unnatural and the longest string in the layout.
#
# "POSSIBLE", NOT "SUSPECTED", and that is a TTS constraint rather than a
# wording preference. "Suspected" is se-SPEC-ted: an unstressed initial
# syllable, which is exactly where neural TTS reduces hardest, and at the START
# of an utterance there is no preceding context to carry it. The rendered clip
# lost the /se/ outright and landed as "spected spam call" -- the files were not
# truncated (66 ms of lead-in silence, same as the genuine lines), the model
# simply never voiced it. "Possible" is stressed on its first syllable, so the
# failure mode cannot arise. Any replacement must keep that property.

# rather than as a decision the driver made.
#
# A recognisable cold-open pitch. ONE COMPLETE SENTENCE, deliberately: the first
# draft trailed off into "Our records show..." on the assumption the auto
# hang-up would cut it, but CONNECTED_HOLD_S is longer than the clip, so the
# fragment played in full and simply stopped -- which reads as a broken file

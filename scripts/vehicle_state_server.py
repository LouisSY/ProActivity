"""
REMOTE vehicle-state bridge: reads a local CARLA instance and serves the state
over HTTP for a ProVoice running on ANOTHER machine.

    python scripts/vehicle_state_server.py --port 8080 --vehicle-id 42

start_experiment.py --remote starts this for you, passing the vehicle id it has
already validated, and prints the matching ProVoice command line for the other
machine. Over the internet rather than a LAN, put a tunnel in front of it:

    ngrok http 8080

and pass the tunnel URL as vehicle_state_url=... to ProVoice.

NOTE: for a LOCAL, same-machine setup do NOT use this script -- use
scripts/vehicle_state_file_bridge.py instead. It publishes the same fields
through a file rather than a socket, which keeps the network stack out of the
loop entirely (see that file's header for the bugcheck history).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONNECTION HANDLING -- why this is not a plain BaseHTTPRequestHandler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first version of this script spoke HTTP/1.0 and its client used
urllib.urlopen, which sends "Connection: close". At ProVoice's 20 Hz poll rate
that is ~20 TCP connect/teardown cycles per SECOND, ~36,000 per 30-minute
session, each one churning kernel socket state (and, on Windows, leaving a
TIME_WAIT entry behind). That connection churn is the single kernel path the
HTTP bridge introduces and nothing else in the experiment touches, and it is
the prime suspect for the two machine bugchecks of 2026-07-28.

So this version:

  * speaks HTTP/1.1 with keep-alive and always sends an accurate
    Content-Length, so one connection carries the whole session's polls;
  * is threaded, which keep-alive makes mandatory -- a persistent connection
    occupies its handler thread for as long as it is open, so a single-threaded
    server would serve exactly one client, forever;
  * drops idle connections after --idle-timeout so a peer that vanishes without
    a FIN does not leak a thread for the rest of the session;
  * reports "N requests served over M TCP connection(s)" every --stats-every
    seconds. With a keep-alive client, M stays at 1 per client for the whole
    run -- that line is how you confirm the churn is actually gone.

The matching client change is in ProVoice's DataCollector._poll_vehicle_state,
which now holds one http.client connection open instead of calling urlopen per
poll. Keep-alive needs BOTH ends: a server that offers it and a client that
closes anyway saves nothing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARLA HANDLING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A background thread samples CARLA at a fixed rate and requests are served from
the last cached record. This decouples three things that used to be one:

  * CARLA's RPC load no longer depends on how many clients poll, or how fast --
    the old version issued ~8 RPC calls per REQUEST, straight from the handler;
  * a slow or hung CARLA read can no longer stall an HTTP request (a request is
    now a dict lookup and a socket write);
  * a lost CARLA connection is recoverable in place: the sampler rebuilds the
    client, re-resolves the actor and carries on, instead of the process dying.

Every response carries X-State-Age, the age of the cached record in seconds,
measured on THIS machine with a monotonic clock. The reader uses that header
rather than the record's wall-clock "ts" to detect a stalled feed, because the
two machines' wall clocks do not agree and a few seconds of skew would
otherwise make a perfectly fresh feed look stale.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SESSION IDENTITY (/session)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The launcher on THIS machine mints the session id and knows the participant
id; the ProVoice on the other machine has to end up with the same two strings
or the session's logs are split between two names and only post-hoc analysis
notices. Passing them on the command line means a human retypes them, so
--session-id/--participantid are published here at /session and ProVoice reads
them from the URL it is already pointed at.

/session also carries --status-url, the address of the REVERSE bridge on this
machine (scripts/provoice_status_server.py, which carries ProVoice's
started/ended signals back here). Same reasoning one level up: the ProVoice
machine is given ONE address, and everything else about the pairing follows
from it.

Deliberately NOT part of the state record: that record is sampled at --hz and
its field set is shared verbatim with the file bridge (see the import below),
whereas this is static, per-process metadata read exactly once at startup.

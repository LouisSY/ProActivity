r"""The K curve for ONE function — the live study's actual deployment condition.

The live follow-up study fires exactly one interactive event, ``Respond to a
phone call``, and serves a head personalized for it. Every offline K curve
produced so far pools all five functions, so none of them measures the thing the
study deploys. This script does: it personalizes on **that function's labels
only** and evaluates on **that function's temporal tail only**.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
----------------
It selects NOTHING. tau, the population configuration, the ANIL configuration
and the LODO checkpoints are all frozen inputs, read from the artifacts the
earlier stages already wrote. There is no grid, no ranking and no
``selected_*.json`` output. Adding one would re-open the selection-validity
question (``docs/selection_validity.md``) on a query tail far too small to
support it -- see the warning below.

WHAT CHANGES RELATIVE TO ``compare_arms_k_curve``
-------------------------------------------------
Only the segment filter, and two things that follow from it:

  * **A dense K grid.** ``sweep_train_frac.K_GRID_BASE`` runs to 60 and is spaced
    for pools of 66-99 segments. Restricted to one function a driver's pool is
    13-22 segments, so the fixed grid would return ~10 usable points with gaps
    exactly where the curve moves. Every integer K is used instead, which is
    what "all values for K until the maximum possible" asks for and costs less
    compute than the pooled sweep did.
  * **Ragged K.** Pools differ per driver (13-22), so above ``k_common =
    min(n_pool)`` the cohort mean is taken over a SHRINKING and non-random
    subset of drivers. Driver difficulty spans ~0.2 to ~1.9 set-MAE here, an
    order of magnitude more than any arm effect, so a mean over a changing
    driver set is not comparable to the one beside it. The headline statistics
    are therefore computed over ``K <= k_common`` only, and everything above it
    is plotted dashed and labelled with its driver count.

READ THE NOISE WARNING BEFORE READING THE CURVE
-----------------------------------------------
At ``--val-frac 0.3`` the query tail is **5-10 segments per driver** (median 8),
against 28-41 in the pooled sweeps. Per-cell noise is therefore roughly 2x the
~0.10 already measured there, and the per-driver curves will be visibly ragged.
Two further properties of this slice are structural, not fixable by more
compute, and are printed at run time:

  * driver 010 marked LoA 2 on all 24 of their phone-call windows, so a constant
    is the Bayes-optimal predictor for them and set-MAE 0 is attainable by the
    lookup;
  * 003, 007 and 009 used only two distinct levels.

The cohort-level paired comparison over 12 drivers is still meaningful -- it is
blocked on driver, so per-driver difficulty cancels exactly -- but a single
driver's curve is not.

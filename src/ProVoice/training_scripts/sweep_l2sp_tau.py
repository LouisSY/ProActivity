"""Stage 3 — L2-SP prior-precision sweep: tau x K over all 12 drivers.

Produces ``selected_tau.json`` (the single tau every downstream L2-SP and ANIL
run uses) and the per-driver personalization learning curves.

THE L2-SP ARM HAS EXACTLY ONE HYPERPARAMETER
--------------------------------------------
At convergence the adapted head theta* depends only on (Z, V, theta_pop, lambda)
— ``steps`` and ``lr`` decide only WHETHER the MAP is reached, not where it is,
and ``head_adapt`` reaches it (|grad| ~ 1e-7, re-checked every call). So the
whole search space is tau. That is worth stating in the write-up next to the
ANIL arm's five knobs: "equal tuning budget" cannot mean equal config counts
when one arm's space is one-dimensional by construction.

WHY THE SWEEP IS 2-D AND NOT "TUNE tau AT ONE K"
------------------------------------------------
The empirically best tau drifts with K (ordinary ridge behaviour). Anchoring at
one K0 therefore makes the SHAPE of the quality-vs-K curve partly an artifact of
where the anchor was placed — and that shape is what research question (b)
reads. Since one tau is committed to for comparability, the right tau is the one
that makes the whole curve good, so tau is selected on the curve, not at a point.

WHY EACH DRIVER USES ITS OWN FOLD CHECKPOINT
--------------------------------------------
Driver d is adapted from ``pop_heldout_d.pt`` — the stage-2 model trained on the
OTHER 11 drivers. Using one model trained on all 12 would start every curve from
a backbone that had already seen that driver: the curves would be optimistic AND
tau would be tuned for a leaky regime. That is a representation-level leak, far
worse than the (accepted, disclosed) one-scalar leak from selecting tau on
aggregate across drivers.

AGGREGATION
-----------
Average over K WITHIN each driver first, then across drivers. Drivers contribute
94-136 segments, so a flat mean over all (driver, K) points would silently weight
the long sessions. Only K <= ``--k-cap`` (default 60, ~25 min of labelling) enters
the average: beyond that is not a deployable condition and must not be allowed to
choose tau. Curves are still plotted over the full range.

TIE-BREAK, fixed in advance so it is not a post-hoc choice: among tau values
within one between-driver SE of the best mean, take the LARGEST tau. It degrades
more gracefully at low K and is the more conservative claim.

Writes ``trained_models/user_study/xlstm_p<pid>_k<condition>.pt`` — the exact
path ``start_experiment.study_model_path`` will look for — for every participant
and every condition:

    condition 0  ->  K=0   the driver's own LODO population model, unadapted
    condition 1  ->  K=4   adapted on their first 4 phone-call labels
    condition 2  ->  K=8   adapted on their first 8

WHY L2-SP AND NOT ANIL
======================
Decided on ``results/phone_call_k_curve`` — the only offline curve that measures
the deployment condition (personalize on ``Respond to a phone call`` labels only,
score on that function's temporal tail only). Paired over 12 drivers:

    K   L2-SP   ANIL    anil-l2sp        ANIL better on
    0   0.948   0.818   -0.130 (1.15 SE)      5/12
    4   0.708   0.686   -0.022 (0.49 SE)      4/12
    8   0.514   0.501   -0.013 (0.19 SE)      3/12

The arms are indistinguishable at both study K values (the run's own headline:
Wilcoxon p=0.73, "indistinguishable"), and note the sign counts: L2-SP is better
for 8 of 12 drivers at K=4 and 9 of 12 at K=8, while ANIL's nominally lower MEAN
is carried by two or three large wins. By the median driver L2-SP *is* the better
model, so "pick the best one" does not select ANIL either.

**The argument that decides it is definitional, not statistical.** The K=0
condition has to mean *no personalization*. The ANIL meta-init is a model whose
entire training objective was "be easy to personalize" -- it IS personalization
machinery, and labelling it the no-personalization control is a category error
regardless of its MAE. L2-SP's K=0 is ``pop_heldout_<pid>.pt``, a population
model and nothing else, which is exactly the claim the condition makes.

That also settles the mixed design, which is the one arrangement that is
outright broken: LODO at K=0 with ANIL at K>0 puts a different backbone under the
baseline than under the treatments, so part of the K effect is the backbone
changing. (Treat the size of that part as unknown rather than as the 0.130 floor
gap -- that gap is itself only 1.15 SE and favours L2-SP on 7 of 12 drivers.)

One measurement consequence, worth knowing before anyone argues for all-ANIL on
"use the best models" grounds: a better floor COMPRESSES the effect the study
exists to measure. All-ANIL runs 0.818 -> 0.686 -> 0.501 (K span -0.317);
all-L2-SP runs 0.948 -> 0.708 -> 0.514 (-0.434), and the K=0->K=4 step nearly
halves, -0.240 to -0.132. With 12 participants and a satisfaction DV that is
power there is none to spare.

WHERE "USE THE BEST MODELS" ACTUALLY BITES -- AND IT IS NOT THE ARM
==================================================================
Two things in this file already answer it, and both are worth defending out loud
rather than leaving implicit.

**Phone-call-only support is ~7x more label-efficient than the alternative.**
Scored on the identical phone-call tail, support drawn from ALL functions
(``phone_call_k_curve_all``) needs K~60 to reach what this function's own labels
reach at K=6:

    K            4       6       8      40      60
    function  0.708   0.467   0.514     --      --
    all       0.827   0.876   0.833   0.648   0.430

**And K=8 is already the plateau for this function**, so the supervisor's premise
-- more data in the real world -- does not imply a better condition-2 model here.
K=13 reaches 0.492 against K=8's 0.514: K=8 captures ~95% of the total achievable
gain, and the remaining 0.022 is noise at a 5-10 segment tail.

NOT a reason: "LODO wins at few labels and ANIL at many". The measured pattern is
the reverse at the low end (ANIL's mean is nominally better at K=1-4 and L2-SP's
at K=5-6), and nothing anywhere on the curve clears 1 SE except K=6. At K=4 the
mean favours ANIL while only 4 of 12 drivers do — the mean is carried by a couple
of large wins, so even the sign is unreliable. Do not report a K-dependent
crossover; there is no evidence for one.

THE SUPPORT SET IS THE DRIVER'S FIRST K PHONE-CALL LABELS
=========================================================
Chronological, from their population session, with no gap and no selection:
``pool_idx[:K]`` where the pool is every phone-call segment recorded before the
evaluation tail. That is bit-identical to the support ``phone_call_k_curve`` used
at the same K, which is what makes the deployed checkpoint the same estimator as
the curve the K values were read off — the property CLAUDE.md requires and the
one ``--verify-against`` actually checks, cell by cell, against that run's CSV.

Everything downstream of ``embed_segments`` is a ~260-parameter convex fit on a
(K x 76) tensor, so the whole cohort costs one backbone pass per driver.

TAU=1.0, ADOPTED FROM THE CURVE -- NOT ``committed_tau.json``
=============================================================
``results/committed_tau.json`` commits tau=0.05 for both arms. **It was never
applied.** Confirmed by the operator on 2026-08-25 and corroborated on disk: the
phone-call curve records tau=1.0, ``selected_anil.json`` records tau=1.0, and the
only runs at 0.05 (``results/arm_comparison``, 2026-08-19) predate the ANIL sweep
and use a superseded ANIL with a different unadapted floor.

So this script adopts tau, steps, val_frac and embed_fcd from
``--match-curve``'s own JSON. The reason is not deference to history: the ladder
0.948 / 0.708 / 0.514 that justified K=4 and K=8 is a **tau=1.0 ladder**, and K
was read off it. Deploy at 0.05 and the served head corresponds to no measured
curve point -- ``--verify-against`` would be comparing two different estimators,
and the study's independent variable would have been chosen on a curve the
deployment does not sit on.

What that costs, stated rather than left to be discovered: **tau=0.05 is
measurably better at these K.** Mean set-MAE over K in 1..12 on
``results/l2sp_sweep_fcd_extend``, monotone in tau: 0.005 -> 1.3135,
0.05 -> 1.3390, 0.5 -> 1.3576, **1.0 -> 1.3653**. A weaker anchor wins at every
low K, which is the opposite of the usual intuition. Adopting it properly means
re-running the phone-call curve at 0.05 and re-reading K off the new curve --
and, for the ANIL arm, re-meta-training, since iMAML's inner loop is
tau-dependent. Until then, matching the curve is worth more than 0.026 of
set-MAE against a between-driver sd of 0.343.

**Do not re-select tau on the phone-call slice** in any case: 5-10 query segments
per driver is exactly the selection-validity problem ``phone_call_k_curve``
refuses to open.

WHAT PROVENANCE GETS WRITTEN, AND WHY IN ``arch``
=================================================
``arch['study']`` carries participant_id, held_out_pid, arm, condition, K, tau,
the support segment ids, and the base checkpoint's sha256. It rides in ``arch``
because that is already the checkpoint's data contract, it survives a rename, and
the serving loader needs it to assert the held-out pid equals ``--participantid``
before a session starts. **That assert does not exist yet** — this script only
makes it possible. Serving 004's head to 003 is silent and unrecoverable after
the fact, so wire it before the first participant.

r"""Stage 1 — population-model hyperparameter sweep.

    dropout in {0.10, 0.15, 0.20}  x  lr in {1e-3, 2e-3}
    x  6 fixed validation folds of 2 drivers  x  5 seeds   =  180 runs

Writes ``selected_population.json``: the winning ``(dropout, lr)`` and **E\***,
the epoch count stage 2 then trains for with no validation set at all.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
The population model is the initialization BOTH study arms adapt from (the ANIL
arm warm-starts from it), so it is tuned once, here, and then frozen. Tuning it
per arm would make the arms differ by more than their meta-objective, which is
the one thing the comparison is supposed to isolate.

WHY 5 SEEDS RATHER THAN A BIGGER GRID
-------------------------------------
Validation set-MAE swings by roughly +/-0.3 between adjacent epochs on ~250
validation segments (measured), while the differences between neighbouring
configurations are far smaller. A single run per configuration cannot rank them.
Compute is better spent averaging that noise away than on grid points: with 12
drivers the validation signal supports separating a handful of configurations,
not dozens.

WHY THE FOLDS ROTATE
--------------------
Every driver serves as validation in exactly one fold (see ``folds.py``), so the
chosen configuration rests on all 12 drivers rather than on whichever 2 were
picked. The cost is that hyperparameters have then seen every driver, including
each LODO test driver — a deliberate, disclosed trade: it is one configuration
choice, shared identically by both arms, so it shifts the absolute numbers but
cancels in the arm comparison. State it in the write-up; do not quietly rely on
it.

HOW E* IS EXTRACTED
-------------------
NOT the argmin epoch — with SE ~0.05 per epoch, the argmin over ~100 epochs is
mostly noise, and taking it would also make E* systematically late (a lucky
epoch is more likely to be found the longer you look). Instead: smooth each
run's validation curve with a centred moving average, take that curve's minimum,
then the MEDIAN across the 30 runs of the winning configuration. Median rather
than mean because a run that early-stops early truncates its curve.

RESUMABILITY
------------
180 trainings is long enough that the process will be interrupted. Every
completed run appends one row to the results CSV, and a restart skips any
(dropout, lr, fold, seed) already present. Delete the CSV to start over.

    fresh process-global torch RNG state and a clean CUDA allocator, and a crash
    in run 97 of 180 should cost that run, not the sweep.

    ``threads`` caps the child's intra-op thread pool, which is what lets ``--jobs``
    trade width for count. This model does not scale inside a process: at 12 torch
    threads it is only **1.82x** faster than at 1, and 16 threads is slower than 4.
    The tensors are too small to amortize the synchronization and the rest goes
    into barrier spin -- which Windows reports as >90% CPU while throughput stays
    flat.

    MEASURED aggregate step throughput (12-physical/16-logical box, real concurrent
    processes -- NOT extrapolated from the single-process thread curve, which
    overstates this badly by assuming idle cores deliver full speed):

        1 proc x 16 thr   15.8 steps/s   (baseline)
        4 proc x  4 thr   31.8           2.01x
        8 proc x  1 thr   32.1           2.04x
       12 proc x  1 thr   34.7           2.20x

    Per-process step time degrades from 94 ms alone to 346 ms at 12-way, so the
    spare cores are contended rather than idle -- the ceiling is ~2x, not the ~6x
    the thread curve alone suggests. END-TO-END on a real 4-run sweep, which also
    pays the ~4.7 s per-process fixed cost: 259 s sequential -> 112 s at 4x4,
    **2.31x**. 4x4 beat 8x1 in every measurement.

    DETERMINISM: torch CPU reductions depend on the thread count, so the SAME seed
    at a different --threads-per-job produces a slightly different trajectory
    (verified: 25 identical steps diverge at the 8th significant digit; the same
    thread count reproduces bit-exactly). Each run remains a valid sample, but a
    sweep half-run at one setting and resumed at another mixes two numeric
    regimes. Keep --jobs/--threads-per-job FIXED for a whole stage, the same way
    --decision-hz is held fixed across participants.

    """Rank configurations, pick the winner and E*, write selected_population.json.

    ``rank_on`` selects WHICH validation quantity decides both the winning
    configuration and E*:

    * ``set_mae`` (default, historical) - the UNADAPTED held-out-driver score.
    * ``adapt_set_mae`` - the score after the deployed per-driver adaptation,
      available only for runs trained with ``--adapt-eval``.

    The second is the criterion that matches what the population model is FOR:
    it is never served unadapted, and both ``xlstm_maml.evaluate_adaptation``
    and ``sweep_l2sp_tau`` already select on their own post-adaptation numbers.
    Switching changes E* as well as the ranking, which is the point - the epoch
    that minimizes source error need not be the one that adapts best, and stage 2
    consumes E* with no validation set of its own to catch a bad value.

    Both column sets are always written, so a completed sweep can be re-ranked
    either way without retraining.

    ``label_path``/``adapt_ks`` are needed only for ``adapt_set_mae``, to rebuild
    the matched per-driver floor (``adapt_fold_baseline``).

    ``select_window``/``select_loss`` RESTRICT which configurations may win. A
    results file is allowed to hold several (window_seconds, loss) groups — the
    ``--window-seconds`` and ``--loss`` flags advertise that a corn and a ce sweep,
    or a 5 s and a 20 s sweep, can share one ``--outdir`` without their artifacts
    colliding. They do not collide, but they are DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS, and ranking
    them against each other picks the easier group rather than the better
    configuration. Without these arguments a mixed file therefore refuses to
    produce ``selected_population.json`` instead of silently crowning a winner
    from the wrong group. The full table is always printed either way.

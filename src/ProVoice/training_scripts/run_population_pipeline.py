r"""Population-sweep pipeline: four sweeps, in order, resumable at any point.

    1. corn_w10   soft-CORN, 10 s window, FULL grid          (3 dropout x 2 lr)
    2. corn_w5    soft-CORN,  5 s window, winner of stage 1
    3. corn_w20   soft-CORN, 20 s window, winner of stage 1
    4. ce_w10     softmax/CE, 10 s window, FULL grid         (the ablation)

Each stage writes to its OWN directory — its own ``sweep_results.csv``, its own
``runs/`` curve folder, its own ``selected_population.json``. Nothing is shared,
so a stage can be deleted and redone without touching the others, and the four
tables stay independently readable.

WINDOW GRID — ``--window-grid {full,inherit}`` (default: full)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Window length is a DATA CONTRACT, not a regularizer: it changes what the model
sees, not how hard it is pushed to fit, so it should not interact strongly with
dropout or lr. ``inherit`` leans on that: tune once at 10 s, reuse the winner at
5 s and 20 s, 2 x 30 runs instead of 2 x 180.

It is an ASSUMPTION though, and a checkable one — shorter windows carry less
signal per sample, which could genuinely favour more dropout. ``full`` (the
default) drops it and sweeps dropout x lr at every window: 720 runs instead of
420. Prefer it whenever the compute exists, for two reasons:

  * Each window is then judged AT ITS OWN BEST, which is the question a
    deployment choice actually asks — not "which window wins at 10 s's
    hyperparameters".
  * It strictly dominates in information. The controlled comparison (all three
    windows at ONE fixed dropout/lr) is a SUBSET of the full grid, so it can
    still be read off ``sweep_results.csv`` afterwards by filtering. The reverse
    is not true: ``inherit`` cannot reconstruct the full grid.

Under ``full`` the window stages no longer depend on stage 1, so they can run in
any order and an interrupted stage 1 does not block them.

WHY CE IS LAST AND FULL-GRID
----------------------------
It is the ablation, not a candidate: the Laplace UQ layer refuses a non-CORN
head, so CE cannot be the deployed arm whatever it scores. It runs last so an
interruption costs the ablation rather than the result. It gets the full grid
because a handicapped ablation is worse than no ablation — if CE loses, it has
to lose at its own best setting. Use ``--ce-seeds`` to trade seeds for wall
clock if time runs short; the head effect measured so far (~0.10-0.14 MAE at a
fixed decoder) is larger than the seed noise.

RECOVERY
--------
Re-run the exact same command. Two independent layers:

  * WITHIN a stage — the sweep skips any (dropout, lr, window, loss, fold, seed)
    already in its CSV, so an interrupted stage continues from the next run.
  * ACROSS stages — a stage is "done" when its CSV holds every expected row.
    Completed stages are re-summarized (seconds) rather than retrained, and
    stages 2 and 3 refuse to start until stage 1 is genuinely complete, since
    they need its winner.

No state file: completion is derived from the artifacts themselves, so deleting
a stage's directory is all it takes to force a redo, and a crashed run cannot
leave the pipeline believing something finished that did not.

Usage::

    python -m ProVoice.training_scripts.run_population_pipeline \
        --in data/labeled_data.jsonl --outdir results/pop_pipeline

    # resume after an interruption: the identical command
    # inspect without running anything:
    python -m ProVoice.training_scripts.run_population_pipeline --outdir ... --status

r"""Quick L2-SP anchor (tau) sweep - a go/no-go check before the population sweep.

    tau grid  x  K grid  x  1-2 folds,  on ONE trained backbone per fold.

WHY THIS RUNS FIRST
-------------------
``--adapt-tau`` defaults to 2.0 and that value is a PLACEHOLDER: the committed tau
comes from stage 3 (``sweep_l2sp_tau``), which needs stage-2 checkpoints, which
need stage 1, which is the sweep this check precedes. The circularity is real and
has to be broken somewhere.

It matters because tau controls how far adaptation is allowed to move off the
population head. ``head_adapt`` derives ``lambda = tau / 2K``, so a tau that is
too large pins the adapted head to the anchor and personalization does almost
nothing - which is indistinguishable, from the outside, from "this cohort has no
personalizable signal". Before spending ~5 hours on a 36-run population sweep at
a guessed tau, spend ~10 minutes finding out whether that guess cripples the
thing being measured.

WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------
Not a replacement for ``sweep_l2sp_tau``. That one runs all 12 drivers against
their own LODO checkpoints and produces the committed value with per-driver
learning curves. This one runs 1-2 folds against a quickly-trained backbone and
answers one question: **is the default tau in the right ballpark, or is it
strangling adaptation?** Treat the winner as a provisional input to stage 1, not
as the study's tau.

NO LEAK
-------
Each fold's backbone is trained on that fold's 10 TRAINING drivers and adapted on
its 2 held-out ones - the same guarantee ``sweep_l2sp_tau`` documents when it
insists driver d be adapted from ``pop_heldout_d.pt``. Adapting from a model that
has already seen the driver would make every curve optimistic AND tune tau for a
regime that never ships.

COST
----
The backbone is trained once per fold and CACHED (``--ckpt-dir``); re-runs at a
different tau grid cost nothing but the adaptation. Embeddings are computed once
per fold, so each (tau, K) cell is ~2000 AdamW steps on a (K x 64) tensor,
~3 s. A 7 x 4 grid on one fold is ~3 minutes of adaptation on top of one
training run.

#                              DEPLOYMENT-REALISTIC: a served system that had
#                              reached segment K would hold exactly these labels.
#                              But the query CHANGES with K, so the curve confounds
#                              "more support" with "different test set".
#   tail    (`*_tail`)         query = the last --eval-tail segments, fixed.
#                              K is then the only thing varying, which is what a

#                              Costs realism: at small K the support is far in the
#                              past relative to the query, which no deployment
#                              would be.

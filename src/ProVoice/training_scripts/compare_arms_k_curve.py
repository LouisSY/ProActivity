r"""Stage C — the K curve for BOTH arms, and the paired comparison between them.

This is the study's primary offline result: personalization quality against the
number of driver labels K, for the L2-SP arm and the ANIL arm, and the
**paired per-driver difference** between them.

WHAT MAKES IT A COMPARISON
--------------------------
The arms differ in exactly ONE thing: theta_init. Everything else is held
identical, and most of it by construction rather than by convention —

  * the same ``head_adapt.adapt_head``, the same 2000 full-batch steps,
  * the same tau (frozen from the L2-SP sweep, used by ANIL's inner problem too),
  * the same K grid, the same temporal tail, the same 12 LODO folds,
  * per driver, the ANIL init warm-started from that fold's OWN L2-SP population
    checkpoint, so neither arm has seen the held-out driver.

Both curves therefore come out of ``sweep_l2sp_tau`` with only ``--ckpt-dir``
changed, which is the point of having unified the adaptation.

WHY PAIRED
----------
Driver difficulty dominates everything here: per-driver constant floors range
~0.47 to ~1.58, an order of magnitude more spread than any plausible arm effect.
Comparing arm MEANS across drivers throws that pairing away and buries the
effect in between-driver variance. Both arms are evaluated on the SAME driver,
the SAME tail and the SAME K, so differencing within a (driver, K) cell cancels
driver difficulty exactly and leaves the initialization effect.

The headline statistic is the per-driver mean difference over the deployable K
range, tested with a **Wilcoxon signed-rank** over the 12 drivers — paired,
distribution-free, and appropriate at n=12 where normality is untestable.

READING A NULL
--------------
A null (ANIL ~ L2-SP) is an informative finding at ~10 meta-training drivers and
was anticipated by the design. It is only interpretable if the ANIL arm was
genuinely tuned, so this script reports the stage-A caveats — grid-edge outer_lr,
whether meta-training's query loss ever dropped — alongside the result rather
than leaving them in a different file.

        widened in memory at load time, so pop_heldout_*.pt stays narrow; for the

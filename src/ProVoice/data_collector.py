        The toolbox picks the largest FFT peak in 0.6-3.3 Hz (36-198 bpm) with no

        (sharp systolic upstroke, dicrotic notch), and for any true rate below
        99 bpm that 2f peak is still inside the band — so every seated

        Compared against a running median of recent ACCEPTED readings. The
        reference decides ONLY accept/reject; the published value is the raw
        reading, so genuine excursions keep their full amplitude — unlike a
        rolling median, which would flatten any excursion shorter than its own

        A GRADUAL rise never triggers this: intermediate readings are accepted,
        the reference tracks upward, and the band moves with it. Only an
        effectively instantaneous near-doubling matches, which is not reachable

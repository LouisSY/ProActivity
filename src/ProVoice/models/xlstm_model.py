# Fixed-grid resampling — a DATA contract, shared by train and serve.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The collection loop is paced by `sampling_interval` but only ever falls BELOW
# its nominal rate (CPU contention, camera stalls), so the achieved rate varies
# per session: 19.6 Hz and 9.3 Hz have both been measured on the same machine on
# the same day. Moving perception onto worker threads has since made the rate
# much more stable -- 18.6 and 17.9 Hz over two 15-min sessions on 2026-08-07,
# median inter-frame gap 51-53 ms, one gap >0.5 s in 32,892 frames -- but that
# is a property of one machine under one load, not a guarantee, and the whole
# point of this contract is that nothing downstream has to trust it.
# `truncate_frames_by_seconds` already pins the WALL-CLOCK span of
# the input, but the number of recurrent steps spanning that span still floats
# with the rate — 20 s is ~396 frames at 19.6 Hz and ~186 at 9.3 Hz. An xLSTM
# learns its time constants per STEP, not per second, so that is a 2x rescaling
# of every learned dynamic from one session to the next. Worse, the achieved
# rate is set by scene load (night, rain, junctions, YOLO), which correlates
# with both the covariates and the labels, so sequence length is a leakage
# channel: the model can read the condition off the step count instead of off
# the driver.
#
# Resampling each window onto a fixed time grid makes the step count a function
# of the window's DURATION alone. 10 Hz is chosen from the physiology, not from
# the camera: the eye-closure indicator has an integrated autocorrelation time
# of ~830 ms, so a 10 Hz grid is ~8 samples per correlation time — oversampled
# for every feature in STATE_NUM, all of which are 30 s- or 180 s-smoothed.
#
# This runs DOWNSTREAM of the detectors, so it fixes the temporal geometry only.
# A feature mismeasured at collection time (see the duration-gated blink counter
# in data_collector._visual_process, whose yield drops once dt approaches the
# 100/500 ms gate) stays mismeasured; that is a separate problem.
DEFAULT_RESAMPLE_HZ = 10.0

# Columns that may be LINEARLY interpolated onto the grid. Everything else is
# carried from the last real frame at or before each grid point.
#
# The criterion is NOT "is this a float" — it is whether the change BETWEEN two
# consecutive real samples is small relative to the feature's own quantum. Where
# it is, interpolation estimates a value the signal genuinely passed through;
# where it is not, interpolation manufactures a value the pipeline never
# produced and the model never saw at training time.
#
# What is held, and why:
#   * emotion one-hot / lab multi-hot — a blend (emotion_happy=0.4 next to
#     emotion_sad=0.6) is a state that never occurred.
#   * is_night / is_junction — binary.
#   * environment_len / secondary_task_len — a CATEGORY encoded as a string
#     length; the midpoint of two lengths is not a category.
#   * the 12 FCD dims — ordinal 1-5 ratings looked up per FUNCTION, not measured
#     over time. Constant while functionname is (the common case, and always so
#     at serving, where one name applies to the whole window), but a segment
#     spanning a function change would otherwise get a blend of two functions'
#     profiles — a rating vector no real function has.
#   * blink_rate — a deterministic function of an INTEGER count over a trailing
#     window, so there is no continuous latent value to estimate. Two regimes,
#     both measured on data/raw_data.jsonl: for the first 30 s of a session
#     `elapsed_s` is still growing, so the rate decays as 60N/elapsed (370
#     distinct values in one session); after that `elapsed_s` pins to 30 and the
#     rate is exactly 2N — a strict lattice of 2 blinks/min (8 distinct values,
#     84% of all frames). Holding costs <=0.13 blinks/min of ramp error in the
#     first regime and zero in the second; interpolating costs up to a full 2.0
#     quantum in the second. Hold dominates, so the ramp needs no special case.
#   * yawn_rate — same, and without even the ramp: the divisor is the fixed
#     180 s window, so the served feature is Anscombe(N) on {0, 1.12, 1.86, ...}
#     for integer N. Anything between those is a fractional yawn.
#   * hr_delta / rr_delta — the rPPG worker emits an estimate only about every
#     6 s and the collection loop reads the held value on every tick, so these
#     are staircases with ~6.7 s plateaus (measured: 25 and 21 distinct values
#     across a 4867 s recording). Heart rate is a continuous latent signal, but
#     the pipeline never observed it between readings; a plateau of 6.7 s is a
#     third of a 20 s window, so interpolating would reshape a 3-step staircase
#     into a smooth ramp built entirely from values the system never had.
#     Holding also matches the carry-forward the collector already applies
#     between readings.
#
# What survives as linear is exactly the set measured at FULL loop rate and
# moving in small per-frame increments: the two visual driver-state features and
# the CARLA vehicle/world channels.

# that marker's value. They interpolate normally among real readings, but a grid
# point whose two bracketing samples include the marker is HELD instead: a
# blend of a real value and a sentinel reads as a real value and is not one.
#
#   * lead_distance_m — metres to the nearest vehicle ahead in the ego lane, or
#     -1 for "no lead vehicle within the 100 m detection range" (see
#     data_collector._carla_process, which logs that case as null; the null->-1
#     mapping is applied here, in encode_frame, so the raw log keeps saying
#     "nothing there" rather than asserting a distance). A distance is
#     non-negative, so -1 is unambiguous. The marker is NOT interchangeable
#     with 0: 0 m is bumper contact, i.e. the most urgent state the feature can
#     express, and is exactly what `_as01(None)` would otherwise produce.
#     Measured on data/raw_data.jsonl: 73.5 % of frames carry the marker and
#     real readings cluster at both ends (p25 6.6 m, p75 55.8 m), so
#     marker<->real transitions are frequent and large — without this guard each
#     one would be smeared over ~5 grid steps into a closing/receding lead
#     vehicle that never existed.
# Feature names the DataCollector logs under a DIFFERENT key. Read through
# ``_row_get`` so the rename happens in ONE place, on every path into the model.
#
# The bug this exists to prevent: 'ear' is logged as 'eye_ar'. The trainer's
# normalize_row aliased it, encode_frame did not, and the serving path hands
# encode_frame the collector's raw dicts -- so the model TRAINED on real EAR
# (~0.2) and was SERVED a constant 0.0 for that dim, silently, because a missing
# key is indistinguishable from a genuine zero once _as01 has run. Aliasing here
# rather than in each caller is the point: normalize_row WHITELISTS keys, so any
# future feature whose log key differs from its feature name fails the same way.
#
# Prefer the canonical name when both are present; fall through only on
# missing/empty, so a row that already carries 'ear' is untouched.

    ``_relative_times`` — and once per row over the whole training set.
    ``strptime`` costs ~4.7 us/call and is the bulk of that, so the fixed
    ``HH:MM:SS[.fff]`` shape the DataCollector actually writes (100 % of real

      justifies.
    - **'corn': the rank rule of Shi, Cao & Raschka (2023)**,

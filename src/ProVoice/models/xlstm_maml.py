# ANIL meta-training for the xLSTM LoA model (iMAML by default since 2026-08-14;
# second- and first-order are ablations via --order).
#
# ANIL (Raghu et al. 2020) = MAML with the inner loop restricted to the output
# head, including the L2-SP anchor term — i.e. the same objective the deployed
# per-driver adaptation minimizes.
#
# WHY iMAML IS THE DEFAULT rather than an upgrade to adopt later. The deployed
# adaptation (head_adapt.adapt_head) runs 2000 full-batch AdamW steps to the MAP.
# A path-differentiated outer loop must backprop THROUGH the inner trajectory, so
# its inner loop has to be a handful of graph-resident SGD steps — it structurally
# cannot be the deployed procedure, only an approximation of it. Implicit
# differentiation needs the inner problem's SOLUTION and never its path, so iMAML
# meta-learns the anchor of exactly the objective that gets served. Verified
# numerically on participant 001 at tau=2: max|theta_newton - theta_adam| is
# 1.6e-05 at K=5 and <= 3.4e-06 for K in {10, 30, 99}.
#
# The reverse fix — serving a truncated few-step head so deployment matches
# path-differentiated meta-training — is ruled out by the UQ layer: the Laplace
# expansion is taken about the MAP, so a truncated head would make the posterior
# valid for the L2-SP arm and invalid for ANIL, which the design forbids.
#
# The outer loop runs in one of three modes (--order):
#   - 'second' (ABLATION — standard ANIL as published): the inner-loop
#     trajectory is differentiated exactly (create_graph, no detach). Support
#     embeddings stay in the graph, so the backbone receives BOTH the query
#     pathway and the support pathway (how the support embeddings shaped the
#     adapted head — the term that trains the representation for
#     adaptability). The double backward is confined to the tiny head + loss;
#     the xLSTM backbone itself only ever does ordinary first-order backprop,
#     so no second derivatives pass through the recurrent unroll.
#   - 'first' (ABLATION, FOMAML-style FO-ANIL — Yuksel et al. 2024): support
#     embeddings are computed under no_grad (dropping the support pathway) and
#     the gradient w.r.t. the head INITIALIZATION is approximated by the
#     gradient at the ADAPTED head parameters. Cheaper, immune to
#     inner-Jacobian amplification, but biased toward joint training.
#   - 'imaml' (DEFAULT — implicit MAML, Rajeswaran et al. 2019): the inner problem is
#     SOLVED to its argmin (full-batch LBFGS) and the meta-gradient comes from
#     implicit differentiation of the stationarity condition — i.e.
#     meta-learning the anchor of the CONVERGED L2-SP adaptation, independent
#     of inner-lr/steps. Exact at this head size (dense Hessian solve, no
#     CG/GGN approximation), and captures both the anchor and the support
#     pathways. Only meaningful when λ is binding enough that the deployed
#     fine-tune also (approximately) converges its proximal problem; the
#     implicit gradient is biased whenever the inner solve stops early, so
#     the solver residual is reported per epoch.
# Head-only inner loop != meta-learning only the head: the outer loop still
# meta-trains the whole backbone for adaptability; that is what distinguishes
# the result from the joint-trained warm start it begins from.
#
# Outer-loop optimization (decision record: docs/meta_optimization_options.md;
# neither knob touches the deployed adaptation or the two-arm comparison):
#   - --outer-opt (default nadam): NAdam's Nesterov look-ahead (Dozat 2016;
#     LaANIL, Tammisetti et al. 2024) damps oscillation from noisy
#     meta-gradients — the realistic failure mode at ~15 tasks. Chosen over
#     cosine LR annealing, whose late-schedule payoff is neutralized here by
#     best-checkpoint selection + early stopping.
#   - --fo-warmup-epochs: derivative-order annealing (MAML++, Antoniou et al.
#     2019) — the first N meta-epochs run in first-order mode before switching
#     to the requested --order. FO's conservative bias makes it a stabilizing
#     pretraining stage; MAML++ reports no gradient explosions under DA where
#     second-order-only runs were unstable. This is the designated remedy if
#     the pre-registered instability criterion fires.
#
# Episode design: support = temporally CONTIGUOUS block of
# K ∈ [k-min, k-max] segments, query = the segments immediately AFTER it —
# never a random support/query split, which would leak within-session
# autocorrelation. --episode-start prefix restricts support to the session
# prefix (exactly the deployment situation); the default 'any' treats every
# mid-session point as a pseudo session start, which preserves the
# support-before-query direction while giving combinatorial episode diversity
# from only ~15 drivers.
#
# Meta-overfitting defenses: warm start from the population checkpoint,
# meta-validation on held-out drivers with early stopping, many subsampled
# episodes per driver, and optional light augmentation (leading-frame crops,
# Gaussian jitter on the numerical feature dims).
#
# The saved checkpoint keeps the population checkpoint's arch contract
# (head_type, context_length, window_seconds, resample_hz) unchanged, so it is a drop-in
# replacement for state_xlstm.pt in fine_tune_XLSTM.py, sweep_train_frac.py,
# and the decision engine: the study comparison is L2-SP fine-tuning from the
# joint-trained init vs. the SAME fine-tuning from this meta-trained init.

    set-MAE/set-QWK on everything after — the same temporal protocol and the
    same set-aware metrics as the sweep script.

    This is the measurement that decides meta-training early stopping, so it is
    the one place where using anything other than the deployed adaptation would
    select a meta-init for a procedure that never runs.

    ``loss_fn`` is unused now that the shared adapter derives it from
    ``head_type``; it is kept in the signature so callers stay unchanged and the
    two cannot silently disagree about which loss adaptation used.

    Runs the ``adapt_head_tensors`` steps on ``device`` (GPU when meta-training
    runs on one), unlike ``train_XLSTM.py``'s ``evaluate_adaptation_val`` and
    the deployed sweep, which deliberately move to CPU first because that
    adaptation is kernel-launch-bound and gains nothing from CUDA. Left on
    GPU here on purpose: this call sits inside the meta-training loop, so its
    tensors are already GPU-resident and round-tripping ~54s/epoch worth of
    calls through the CPU would add its own transfer overhead on the machine

    """:func:`evaluate_adaptation` at SEVERAL support sizes, embedding once.

    Returns ``{requested_K: (set_mae, set_acc, set_qwk, effective_K)}``.

    The driver's whole segment list goes through the backbone ONE time and the
    result is sliced per K. Calling :func:`evaluate_adaptation` in a loop instead
    repeats the only expensive part -- a backbone forward over the driver's ~120
    segments -- once per K, which is what made a wide meta-validation grid look
    unaffordable.

    What that buys, measured on 120 synthetic segments: a 2-point grid drops
    6.8s -> 4.9s per driver per epoch, and a 5-point grid costs 10.8s. So the
    term that scaled with the grid is gone, but the ADAPTATION does not vanish
    -- 2000 AdamW steps is ~2s per (driver, K) and is now the dominant cost.
    Widening {5,10} -> {5,10,20,30,60} is ~1.6x the old validation cost, not the
    2.5x a naive per-K reading would predict; against ~54s/epoch of meta-training
    that is roughly +12% per epoch.

    HOW EXACT THIS IS, measured rather than asserted. ``make_collate`` right-pads
    every segment to the fixed ``context_length``, so no segment's embedding
    depends on the CONTENT of its batch -- but it does depend slightly on the
    batch's SIZE, because that selects a different matmul kernel and so a
    different float32 reduction order. Measured: the support block comes back
    bit-identical, the query block differs by ~1e-6 per embedding coordinate.
    That does not survive to the metric -- the embeddings are consumed by 2000
    adaptation steps and then an argmax over 5 ordinal classes. Checked against
    :func:`evaluate_adaptation` over 3 seeds x K in {5,10,20,30,60}: all 15 cells
    returned identical set-MAE and set-QWK to full printed precision. So this is
    a faster route to the same numbers, NOT a bit-reproducible one; a run that
    needs bit-level reproduction against the old path will not get it.

    Effective K is returned because it is CLIPPED to leave at least one query
    segment; a caller averaging over the grid needs to know when two requested
    K values collapsed onto the same evaluation and are being double-counted.

    Like :func:`evaluate_adaptation`, the per-K ``adapt_head_tensors`` calls
    stay on ``device`` (GPU under meta-training) rather than moving to CPU --
    intentional here, see that function's docstring for why.

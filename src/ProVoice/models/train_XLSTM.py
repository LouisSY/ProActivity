    MAE than the task itself (``constant_baseline``: knowing the driver buys
    0.23, knowing the function 0.06) and is ~68 % recoverable from the state

    sweep cannot separate those — both produce a model that loses to a constant —

    chronological within each driver (verified against the session start times in
    ``user_loa_labels.csv``), which is what makes the tail a genuine FUTURE tail.

# A window's label is the SET of LoAs the driver marked acceptable (~a third of
# real windows mark more than one, and a third of THOSE are non-contiguous, e.g.
# {L1, L5}). Every metric below therefore takes the multi-hot `levels` vector,
# never a collapsed integer.
#
# There used to be an `int(np.argmax(level_vec))` pseudo-label threaded through
# the datasets and into these metrics. np.argmax returns the FIRST maximal index,
# so on a multi-hot vector it always resolved to the driver's LOWEST acceptable
# level — a systematic downward bias in the reference used for model selection,
# meta-validation early stopping, and the published learning curves. The
# `resolve_targets` below replaces it.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
def resolve_targets(levels: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Per-row effective ground truth: the marked level the prediction is judged against.

    Every metric here compares two point values, but the label is a set. This
    resolves the set to the single marked level CLOSEST to the prediction — the
    level the driver would plausibly have named had they been forced to name
    one — so a prediction inside the set is exactly right, and one outside it is
    scored against the nearest acceptable alternative rather than against an
    arbitrary member.

    Properties that make this safe to build every metric on:

    * **Exact reduction.** On a single-label row the only marked level is
      returned regardless of the prediction, so every metric below collapses to
      its ordinary single-label form. Existing single-label results are
      numerically unchanged.
    * **Deterministic ties.** A prediction equidistant from two marked levels
      (e.g. marks {1, 3}, prediction 2) resolves to the LOWER one, via argmin's
      first-match rule. Arbitrary, but fixed — never data-dependent.
    * **Empty rows are inert.** A row with no marked level returns the
      prediction itself, contributing zero error instead of an invented label.
      Callers upstream already reject such rows; this is belt-and-braces.

    CAVEAT, state it when reporting: the resolved target depends on the
    prediction, so these are best-match (oracle-favourable) scores. That is the
    right convention for a set-valued label scored against a point prediction,
    but it means the chance-corrected metric (QWK) is an UPPER BOUND on
    multi-label rows — its "true" marginal shifts with the model. Single-label

    #
    #   * fgate.bias initializes to a per-head linspace(3, 6) — deliberately
    #     large so the forget gates start near-open, i.e. so the cell starts with
    #     a LONG memory. Decaying it toward 0 shortens the memory horizon, which
    #     is precisely the thing a recurrent model over a 20 s window exists to
    #     learn. Same for igate.bias.
    #   * learnable_skip initializes to 1.0; decaying it toward 0 attenuates the
    #     residual path.
    #   * The LayerNorm gains are the EXCEPTION to the usual "never decay norms"
    #     advice. nx-ai's LayerNorm uses residual_weight=True, so the effective
    #     gain is (1 + weight) and the weight initializes to 0.0 — decay pulls it
    #     toward gain 1, i.e. toward the identity. That is a sensible shrinkage,
    #     so norm gains stay in the decay group.
    #
    # At the default weight_decay this changes almost nothing (see the flag's
    # help — decoupled decay is ~0.04 % over a full run). It matters the moment
    # anyone raises it to a value that actually regularizes, which is exactly

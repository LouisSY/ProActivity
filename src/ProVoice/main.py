# ── CPU thread budget ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Must run BEFORE numpy/torch/cv2 are imported: the OpenMP/MKL runtimes size
# their thread pools once, at load time, and ignore these variables afterwards.
#
# Why cap them at all: this process shares the machine with the CARLA server and
# the Drive client, and it holds NO tick of its own — the DataCollector only ever
# reads (get_velocity, get_weather, a cached map), so it never owes the server
# anything and is safe under either clock. An all-core burst here therefore does
# not stall a tick; it starves CARLA's render and physics threads and Drive's
# render loop directly, which the participant sees as dropped frames and laggy
# steering. The cap is what stops this process from taking the whole machine.
#
# Under start_experiment.py --sync that cap matters MORE, not less. The clock is
# then paced against the wall clock by src/drive/fixed_npc_traffic.py, and a
# server starved of CPU cannot complete its fixed step in time — so instead of
# degraded physics you get the whole simulation in slow motion, for the
# participant and for every wall-clock-aligned signal recorded here.
#
# (Two earlier versions of this comment each asserted one clock as a permanent
# fact — first synchronous, then asynchronous. Both are reachable; check the
# --sync flag before relying on any claim about tick ownership.)
#
# Left at its default, torch sizes its intra-op pool to the core count (20 on
# the lab machine) and every xLSTM forward becomes an all-core stampede.
# Measured on a full 320-frame window:
#
#   threads   forward wall   cores busy
#      20         5.6 ms        19.2      <- default
#       4         3.6 ms         4.6
#       2         5.1 ms         2.0      <- default here
#       1         8.1 ms         1.0
#
# 20 threads buys NOTHING in wall-clock over 2 (the ops are tiny; fork/join
# across 20 cores costs more than it saves) while consuming ~10x the CPU. At
# decision_hz=4 that is four all-core bursts per second, which is exactly the
# lag that appears once calibration ends and the decision thread starts running
# full windows. KMP_BLOCKTIME/OMP_WAIT_POLICY stop the idle OpenMP workers
# spin-waiting between bursts, which otherwise keeps the cores hot in between.

    In a --remote run the launcher on the CARLA machine mints the session id and
    holds the participant id, and THIS process has to agree with both or the
    session's LoA labels and raw frames end up filed under different names. The
    bridge publishes them; this reads them back, so neither id depends on a
    human retyping it into a second terminal.

    It waits for the IDS, not merely for the endpoint. Those are different
    events: the bridge starts serving as soon as its socket is open, and a
    /session that answers 200 with two nulls is a bridge that is up but does not
    yet know who is driving. Returning on the first answer would take those
    nulls as the truth and mint a local session id a second later — the exact
    split-identity failure this function exists to prevent. So a nulls-only
    answer is treated like no answer at all and polled again.

    The wait also covers the ordinary case of the two machines being started by
    hand, in either order: a ProVoice launched first would otherwise get one
    refused connection and fall back for the rest of the session. This runs
    ONCE, at startup, so a plain urlopen is right here — the keep-alive
    machinery in DataCollector exists for the 2 Hz state poll, not for this.

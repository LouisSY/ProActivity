        #
        #  1. Reproducible preprocessing. Every BP4D config in the upstream repo
        #     sets DO_CROP_FACE: False against a pre-made "BP4D_72x72" dataset
        #     that no script in the repo produces, so the crop convention behind
        #     the BP4D checkpoints is unknown. The SCAMPS configs specify it in
        #     full (Y5F detector, square box, LARGE_BOX_COEF 1.5, re-detect every
        #     FS frames, INTER_AREA, FS 30) -- which is exactly what this
        #     pipeline now reproduces.
        #  2. Its reported number is measured under OUR deployment condition.
        #     Paper Table 3: MMRPhys+TSFM trained on SCAMPS and tested
        #     cross-dataset on iBVP + PURE + UBFC-rPPG gives HR MAE 1.54 bpm
        #     (Corr 0.900). The BP4D figures are within-dataset (Fold1/2/3), so
        #     they are optimistic and not comparable. The paper also validates
        #     SCAMPS -> BP4D+ transfer directly (SS6).
        #
        # Caveat to validate in the pilot: SCAMPS is rendered, and RGB
        # respiration comes from head motion / pulse-amplitude modulation, which
        # synthetic data models less faithfully than pulse. Trust HR first; check
        # RR against a reference before relying on rr_delta.
        #
        # The checkpoint MUST match ``crop_size``: infer_from_frames dispatches on
        # height (9 -> MMRPhysSEF, 36 -> MMRPhysMEF, 72 -> MMRPhysLEF), so a
        # "...x180x9" (SEF) file with crop_size=72 instantiates LEF instead. That
        # does NOT raise — all three variants share identical state_dict key names
        # and tensor shapes (87,600 params; they differ only in conv strides and
        # head geometry) — so 9x9-trained filters silently run on a 72x72 pyramid.
        # The paper's own ablation (§5) reports 72x72 ~= 36x36 > 9x9 for BOTH rPPG
        # and rRSP, so the x180x72 LEF checkpoint is the one to use.

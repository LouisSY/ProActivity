"""Simulated incoming phone call, handled according to the predicted LoA.

The interactive event of the live follow-up study. Design record and rationale:
``docs/live_study_setup.md`` (§5 the ladder, §6 the UI spec). This module is the
implementation of that spec and nothing else -- it owns no study logic, reads no
files, and knows nothing about K conditions or checkpoints.

WHAT THE LoA CONTROLS
---------------------
The call is a WORLD EVENT, not a system action: the phone rings in every
condition, identically. What the LoA governs is how involved the assistant gets.

This matters and is not decoration. If LoA 0 produced no on-screen event, the
driver would perceive nothing and the satisfaction rating for that window would
have no referent -- and since unpersonalized heads plausibly predict LoA 0 more
often, the unratable windows would concentrate in one experimental condition.
That is missing data correlated with the independent variable.

    LoA  assistant                     affordance        no input ->
    ---  ---------------------------   ---------------   ------------
    0    silent                        ACCEPT / DECLINE  rings out
    1    "Call from X."  + badge       ACCEPT / DECLINE  rings out
    2    "...Want me to answer?"       YES / NO          NOT answered
    3    "...Answering in 3, 2, 1."    CANCEL            ANSWERED
    4    "...Answering now."           none              answered

The "no input" column is the formal content of the ladder: doing nothing yields
*nothing* for 0-2 and *the action* for 3-4, and that flip is what "veto" means.

WHY 0->1 IS ONE MARKER AND 1->2 IS THE WHOLE PANEL
--------------------------------------------------
For a binary, immediate action, "suggest" and "ask approval" collapse in natural
language -- any natural phrasing of a suggestion about answering a call ("want to
take it?") *is* asking approval. So the distinction cannot live in the wording,
and it does not: it lives in who owns the screen. At LoA 1 the driver is
operating their own phone card and the assistant merely annotates it with a
badge; at LoA 2 the card is replaced by an assistant panel and the driver is
answering the assistant, not the phone.

That asymmetry mirrors ``decision_engine._LOA_POLICY``, which groups the levels
low/low/medium/high/high -- the visual hinge sits exactly where the policy hinge
does. These two rungs are ~59% of the labels drivers gave for this function, so
they are the ones that have to be separable.

DEGRADES TO SILENCE, NEVER TO A GUESS
-------------------------------------
Missing audio files, no mixer, no audio device: the panel still renders and the
interaction still resolves, exactly as ``ambience.py`` degrades. What it will
NOT do is invent an LoA -- ``arm()`` refuses a ``None`` LoA and the caller logs a
skipped window, because a fabricated level is indistinguishable from a served one
in the results.

# The panel sits in the HUD band to the RIGHT of the speed readout, sharing its

# the speed is at 0.80 h because that is the base of the windshield, and a panel
# centred on that line would reach ~0.87 h and overlap the rendered wheel.
#
# The box is MEASURED, once, from the widest string any of the five renderings
# can produce (``_measure``), not set to a guessed fraction of the window. A
# fraction has to be picked for the worst case and then looks empty in every
# other state -- which is exactly how the first version read. Measuring keeps
# the footprint identical across the five (the invariant that matters: a panel
# that shrank at LoA 4 would make size a salience cue riding along with the
# condition) while removing the dead space.

# drive_improved binds button 5 as "left paddle -> lower LoA" and 4 as "right
# paddle -> higher LoA". Using the two PADDLES rather than a paddle and a front
# button gives two symmetric controls the driver can find without looking, and
# leaves button 6 (the pop-up's CONFIRM) and button 7 (QUIT, honoured
# everywhere) untouched.
#
# RIGHT is ALWAYS the affirmative (Answer / Yes) and LEFT always the negative
# (Decline / No / Cancel), at every LoA. If they swapped between levels, a motor
# confound would ride along with the condition.
CALL_WHEEL_BUTTON_AFFIRM = 4       # right paddle
CALL_WHEEL_BUTTON_NEGATIVE = 5     # left paddle

# Keyboard fallback. NOT the mnemonic letters: K_l is lights, K_r is recording,
# and K_a/K_b -- which this used to use -- are steer-left and an existing
# toggle, so answering a call also steered the car. Of the free letters, j and k
# are adjacent on the home row with j on the left, which preserves the same

# wheel, so the keyboard labels could only ever appear by accident -- a paddle
# that failed to enumerate, a session started before the wheel was plugged in --
# and the result would be one participant seeing a different panel from the rest,
# silently, with nothing in the data to say so.
#
# The keyboard keys stay live regardless (CALL_KEY_AFFIRM / CALL_KEY_NEGATIVE,
# below): handle_event accepts KEYDOWN and JOYBUTTONDOWN unconditionally and

# ZERO delay from arm() to the ring, and it must stay that way.

# This was 5.0 s, from the superseded design where the call fired at a fixed

# when a call happens (study_session), so the offset bought nothing and cost
# staleness: the served LoA is read at arm time, so every second here is a
# second of the driver's state going out of date before they see the result.
# It also defeated the freshness check, which is applied at READ time -- a
# decision could pass at 250 ms old and ring 5 s stale.
#

# (autonomy is partly a claim about interaction time). The onset must not add
# to it.

# Caller's line, then auto hang-up. Must EXCEED the reply clip or the call cuts
# off mid-sentence: at 3.0 s the 2.82 s "just wanted to catch up" line left 0.18 s
# of headroom, and any edit to that text would have truncated it silently.
# Re-check this whenever caller_reply.wav is re-rendered -- the script prints its
# duration.
CONNECTED_HOLD_S = 4.0
# How long "call rejected" stays up after a spam call is turned away. Short: it
# is an acknowledgement, not an interaction. But NOT zero -- at LoA 4 the

# the same tick, leaving the driver no confirmation that anything happened.
REJECTED_HOLD_S = 1.8
# Silence between the assistant finishing its line and the caller starting.
# Without it the two overlap -- at LoA 4 the assistant says "Answering now" and

# connecting rather than the assistant talking to itself.
POST_SPEECH_GAP_S = 0.35
# ...and a second beat between the call CONNECTING and the caller speaking. A

# --- Spam calls --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Exactly ONE call per block is a suspected spam call, and never the first one;
# the schedule owns that choice (study_session.py), not this module.
#
# WHAT A SPAM CALL CHANGES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
# ----------------------------------------------
# The ladder is untouched. Same five rungs, same owner of the screen at each,
# same meaning for "no input": nothing happens at 0-2, the assistant's action
# happens at 3-4. What flips is WHICH ACTION the assistant proposes -- answer
# becomes reject. A spam call is the same instrument pointed the other way, not
# a sixth condition.
#
# WHY IT IS WORTH THE BUILD
# -------------------------
# On a genuine call "the assistant did the right thing" and "the assistant did
# the more autonomous thing" are the same observation, so a driver who is simply
# passive is indistinguishable from one who agrees -- and passivity is exactly
# what a driving task produces. On the spam call the correct action is to do
# LESS, so the two come apart: pressing nothing at LoA 4 now means the system
# was right, while pressing nothing at LoA 0 means the driver let a spam call
# ring out. That is the only place in the block where the behavioural response
# separates agreement from acquiescence.
#
# CONSEQUENCE FOR THE VETO RUNG. At LoA 3 the no-input path rejects the call and
# the veto KEEPS it, so cancelling connects rather than hangs up. That is not an
# inconsistency with the genuine call -- it is the same rule (the veto does the
# opposite of the announced action) applied to an announcement that has flipped.
#
# "POSSIBLE", NOT "SUSPECTED". A TTS constraint, not a wording preference:
# "suspected" is se-SPEC-ted, an unstressed initial syllable, and neural TTS
# reduces hardest exactly there -- at the start of an utterance there is no
# preceding context to carry it. The rendered clip dropped the /se/ outright and
# landed as "spected spam call"; the file was not truncated (66 ms of lead-in
# silence, same as the genuine lines), the model simply never voiced it. Any
# replacement wording must also be stressed on its FIRST syllable. The screen
# text and the clip move together -- a driver should not have to translate
# between the word they hear and the word they see.

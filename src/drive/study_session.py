"""Driving block for the live follow-up study: timing, LoA source, logging.

One process invocation == ONE block == one K condition. Three blocks means three
runs, with the served checkpoint swapped on the ProVoice side between them. Full
design record: ``docs/live_study_setup.md`` (section 4 the session, 4.2 the
arming rules, 9 the log schema).

WHAT THIS OWNS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
-----------------------------------
This module decides WHEN a call fires, WHICH LoA it carries, and WHETHER it is
the block's spam call, and it writes the outcome. ``call_event.CallEvent`` owns
the interaction itself and knows nothing about schedules, blocks or conditions.
Keeping the split means the renderings can be exercised standalone while the
schedule stays testable on its own clock.

The spam call is decided HERE and never by the model: if the prediction chose
which calls were spam, the manipulation would be confounded with the very thing
it exists to probe. See the SPAM CALL block below.

THE DRIVE PROCESS DOES NOT LOAD A MODEL
---------------------------------------
It never has and it must not start: the model lives on the ProVoice machine and
its prediction arrives over the bridge (``docs/live_study_setup.md`` section 7).
Two sources are supported:

``bridge``  read ``latest_loa`` from the ProVoice status file, session-scoped.
            This is the study configuration.
``random``  draw locally, for testing the drive half without ProVoice running
            at all. Deals a SHUFFLED PERMUTATION of 0..4, so a five-call block
            exercises every rendering exactly once -- five iid draws would leave
            a rung untested about half the time, which is the opposite of what a
            trial run is for.
``sequence`` 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in order. Same coverage as ``random`` but
            predictable, so a reviewer knows which rung is coming and can watch
            for one specific thing.

NEITHER local source is a study configuration. Every row they write is stamped
with its ``loa_source``, so it can never be mistaken for a served prediction.

# --- The spam call -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Exactly ONE call per block is a suspected spam call, and it is NEVER the first.
#
# WHY ONE, AND WHY NOT THE FIRST
# ------------------------------
# One, because it is a probe and not a condition: five calls per block is
# already the whole budget for the K contrast, and spending two of them on the
# inverted proposal would halve the sample for the thing the block exists to
# measure. Never the first, because the first call is where the driver learns
# what the interface does at all -- meeting the inverted proposal before the
# ordinary one would make the exception the reference point, and a driver who
# then treated later genuine calls as suspicious would contaminate the other
# four.
#
# WHY IT IS DRAWN PER BLOCK, NOT FIXED PER DRIVER
# -----------------------------------------------
# A driver sees three blocks. If the spam call sat at the same position in all
# three, they would have every chance to notice -- "the third call is always the
# dodgy one" -- and by block 3 would be responding to the schedule rather than
# to the assistant. Redrawing per block costs nothing in balance: each block
# still contains exactly one spam and four genuine calls, so the K conditions
# remain identical in composition and differ only in where the spam call falls.
# Position is not the manipulation; the proposal is.
#
# Pass an explicit index to pin it (a reviewer wanting to see one rung) -- the
# value is written to every row either way, so a pinned block is identifiable.
SPAM_FIRST_ELIGIBLE_CALL = 2

# only in spam position incomparable.

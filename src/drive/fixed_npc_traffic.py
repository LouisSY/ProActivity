"""Spawn the fixed NPC fleet, and -- with --sync -- own the simulation clock.

WHO TICKS THE WORLD is the whole design question in this file, so it is stated
here rather than left to be rediscovered.

CARLA's traffic manager is not a server-side service: it runs INSIDE the client
process that created it (TrafficManagerLocal), computes controls there and
applies them as batch commands. A traffic manager reached from another process
via the same port is only a remote proxy. That is why the CARLA docs say the TM
"must be set to synchronous mode too in the same client that does the tick" --
the TM's synchronous step is chained to that process's own world.tick() call and
cannot be driven by anyone else's.

The consequence for this project: the process that manages the NPCs and the
process that ticks have to be THE SAME PROCESS. This one manages the NPCs, so in
synchronous mode this one ticks, and Drive (src/drive/drive_improved.py --sync)
becomes a passive client that paces itself with world.wait_for_tick().

A previous attempt put --sync on Drive alone. That set the world synchronous and
synchronised Drive's own traffic manager on port 8000 -- which has no NPC
registered to it -- while the traffic manager actually driving the NPC fleet,
on port 9000 here, was never ticked at all. Every NPC stopped dead. That episode
is recorded as a "nonexistent sync mismatch" in start_experiment.py; it was a
real mismatch, and it was this one.

Second reason the clock lives here: the tick loop below is paced against the
wall clock, so one second of simulated time takes one second of real time no
matter how fast Drive is rendering. Tying the tick to Drive's render loop
instead would make simulated time run at (Drive FPS x fixed_delta_seconds) --
fast-forward on a good frame, slow motion on a bad one. Everything this
experiment measures is wall-clock (the 20 s label window, ProVoice's frame
timestamps, the 60 s calibration, rPPG heart rate off a real camera), so
simulated time drifting against real time under machine load would put a
variable, load-dependent amount of driving inside each label window.

# PER-VEHICLE TRAFFIC MANAGER PARAMETERS
# =========================
#
# Every traffic manager setting that is PER VEHICLE and has a uniform
# (actor, value) signature, mapped to the method that applies it. This table is
# the single place a knob has to be declared: add a line and it is immediately
# settable from DRIVING_PROFILES and from VEHICLE_TM_OVERRIDES, and immediately
# validated at startup.
#
# Deliberately NOT in the table, because they need code rather than a value:
# collision_detection(reference, other, bool) is a PAIRWISE relation between two
# actors, set_path/set_route take a list of locations or turn codes, and
# force_lane_change is a one-shot command rather than a setting.
#
# The unit and sign traps below are CARLA's, not this script's, and every one of
# them has a wrong-looking-but-correct value somewhere in a config:
#   speed_difference   PERCENT, and NEGATIVE means FASTER than the posted limit.
#                      CARLA's own default is +30, i.e. 70% of the limit. The
#                      full history of this one is in the apply pass in main().
#   desired_speed      km/h, ABSOLUTE, and it REPLACES speed_difference rather
#                      than combining with it. Setting both on one vehicle is a
#                      configuration error and is rejected at startup.
#   distance_to_leading METRES.
#   lane_offset        METRES, positive = towards the right-hand lane boundary,
#                      which in these towns is the kerb and the parked cars. The
#                      margin it spends is roughly 0.8 m on a 3.5 m lane -- see
#                      the "lane_bias" profile for the arithmetic and for why
#                      this knob is not the free one it looks like.

#                      0-100, the percent of the time the behaviour applies.
#
# ONE KNOB IS ALMOST ALWAYS WRONG HERE, and it does not look it:
# random_left_lanechange / random_right_lanechange are UNCONDITIONAL. They are
# not "overtake more readily" -- the traffic manager evaluates them continuously
# and without reference to whether anything is in the way, so a vehicle with
# them set weaves between lanes on an empty road. The knob that makes a vehicle
# pass a slower one is auto_lane_change, and the way to make a vehicle pass more
# often is to make it faster. Both random knobs are pinned to 0 in
# _baseline_profile; setting one in a profile is opting a vehicle out of
# behaving purposefully, so do it only if that is genuinely the intent.

    #
    # NOT free, and the earlier claim in this file that it was is wrong. It is
    # free of YIELDING risk -- lane_offset changes where the vehicle sits, not
    # what it gives way to -- but the parked-car failure recorded under
    # LONG_BLUEPRINTS is a GEOMETRY failure, and this spends from exactly the
    # same budget. Measured off Town10HD's OpenDrive:
    #
    #   lane width          3.50 m, every driving lane in the map, all 168
    #   sedan width         ~1.9 m
    #   clearance per side   ~0.80 m before the body crosses the lane edge
    #
    # So 0.2 m spends a quarter of that margin and 0.4 m spends half. Two things
    # then eat the rest, neither of which the traffic manager can see:
    #
    #  - 86 of the map's 153 shoulders are only 0.5-0.6 m wide, which is not
    #    enough to park a ~1.9 m car clear of the road. Wherever those stretches
    #    are lined with parked cars, the meshes already overhang the driving
    #    lane, and the stock fleet only misses them by tracking the centreline.
    #  - 122 of 149 arcs in the map are under 20 m radius, the tightest 7.4 m.
    #    That is where off-tracking happens, and a constant bias adds to it
    #    rather than averaging out: a positive (rightward) offset through a
    #    right-hand bend puts the body toward the kerb for the whole corner.
    #
    # Hence 0.2 m rather than 0.4. Raising it is a real decision, and the thing
    # to watch on the drive is the kerbside on tight corners, not the straights
    # -- on a straight even 0.4 m keeps the body inside the lane. Positive is
    # the parked-car direction, so if contact does show up, biasing the range
    # negative is a cheaper fix than shrinking it further.

    # HAZARD, and the only profile here that can end a session. It runs lights
    # and periodically stops seeing other vehicles, which sooner or later puts a
    # car across the participant's path -- that is the point of it, but it means
    # it is not scene dressing. Assign it deliberately, to a vehicle whose route
    # relative to the participant's you actually know, and never to the whole
    # fleet. A collision with the ego does not just add a hazard, it invalidates
    # everything measured after it.
    # WHAT ignore_vehicles WAS DOING, and why it is gone. At 10% the traffic
    # manager's collision avoidance was switched off a tenth of the time, which
    # is not "drives badly" -- it is "is briefly blind". The vehicle it fails to
    # see can be the participant's, in any geometry, on open road, with no
    # warning and nothing the participant could have read from the scene. That
    # is not a hazard a driver can respond to, so it produces no interpretable
    # behaviour and costs a session when it lands.
    #
    # Without it the car still runs lights and signs, but the traffic manager is
    # steering defensively the whole time, so it brakes for what is in front of
    # it -- including the ego.
    #
    # WHAT THAT DOES NOT MAKE SAFE:
    #
    #  1. Junctions. Collision avoidance reduces the risk of running a red, it
    #     does not remove it: it acts on the NPC's own path with a finite
    #     lookahead, and a crossing conflict at speed is where that is weakest.
    #     More to the point, the participant is NOT traffic-manager controlled
    #     and has no avoidance at all -- a human on green who sees a car come
    #     from the side may brake late or not at all. The NPC being defensive
    #     protects the NPC's plan, not the participant's.
    #  2. The behaviour becomes strange rather than dangerous. A car that enters
    #     a junction on red and then brakes for cross traffic does not sail
    #     through -- it stops dead in the middle of the junction. That reads as
    #     a broken vehicle, not a reckless one, and it blocks the junction for
    #     everyone including the participant.
    #
    # So this is now the honest description: a car that speeds and disregards
    # signals, and that will try not to hit anyone while doing it. Treat it as
    # UNVERIFIED -- nothing here has been driven -- and check it on a rehearsal
    # run before it is in front of a participant.

        "speed_difference": (-25.0, -10.0),

        # makes it incoherent.

# =========================
# ROAD WORKS (SCENERY ONLY)
# =========================
#
# SCENERY, and the word is load-bearing: none of this is in a driving lane and
# none of it changes what any vehicle does. That is not a limitation that could
# be tuned away, it is the only arrangement that works, so it is worth stating
# why before someone moves a cone.
#
# The traffic manager cannot see props. static.prop.* actors are not vehicles or
# walkers, so its collision avoidance does not consider them -- the same reason
# it drives through the parked cars at the kerb (see LONG_BLUEPRINTS). Nothing
# fixes that; there is no setting.
#
# So a cone in a live lane is driven over by every NPC that reaches it, in front
# of the participant. Anchoring the closure on a parked VEHICLE, which the
# traffic manager does see, only moves the problem: the taper is by definition
# upstream of the thing being detected, so the cones leading in are flattened
# before the lane change begins, and keep_right (60 baseline, 80 cautious)
# pulls vehicles back into whatever is coned off behind it.
#
# On the shoulder, "the traffic manager ignores them" costs nothing, because no
# vehicle was ever going to be there. The participant sees a work site; the
# traffic behaves exactly as it would without one.
#
# THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE DRIVING TASK. It varies what the drive looks like
# between scenarios, nothing more. A work zone that actually closes a lane needs
# NPCs routed around it with tm.set_path(), and needs to account for the ten
# heavy vehicles that cannot lane-change at all and would queue behind it
# forever.

# Wide enough to hold a work site clear of the carriageway. Town10HD's driving
# lanes are all 3.50 m and its shoulders come in at 0.5, 0.6, 2.0, 2.5 and
# 3.5 m; this keeps only the 2.0 m and wider, which is 67 of the map's 153

# lane because the shoulder was 0.6 m wide.

    # =========================
    #
    # How many of VEHICLE_CONFIGS each scenario spawns. This is what makes the
    # seed identify a WHOLE SCENARIO rather than just an RNG stream: one number
    # fixes both how much traffic there is and how it behaves, so a session is
    # described completely by the value already on every raw_data.jsonl frame,
    # with nothing else to join against.
    #
    # 42 IS PINNED AT 25 AND MUST STAY THERE. It is the calibration/adaptation
    # condition; those participants are compared against each other, and it has
    # run at twenty-five vehicles for every session so far. Leaving it out of
    # this table would have silently promoted the study arm to forty cars the
    # moment the list grew, changing a fixed condition mid-study without a
    # single line of output saying so.
    #
    # THE DENSITIES ARE ORDERED, which changes what the collection scenarios
    # are: not interchangeable draws but a dose series from 15 to 40 vehicles.
    # That suits a population model that cannot see traffic -- congestion is a
    # main determinant of the labels and the model has to be robust to it unseen
    # -- and the counterbalancing in start_experiment.py's TRAFFIC_SEED_PLAN is
    # undisturbed by relabelling seeds: over its twelve participants each
    # density is driven six times, three as a first run and three as a second,
    # and every ORDERED pair of densities occurs exactly once.
    #
    # 33 (25 VEHICLES) IS RETIRED. The study went from five collection scenarios
    # to four, and 33 is the one dropped -- the middle rung, so the 15-40 range
    # is unchanged. Its row stays here on purpose: start_experiment.py's
    # COLLECTION_SEEDS no longer contains it, so it cannot be assigned by the
    # plan, but --traffic-seed 33 remains a legal off-plan pilot and should
    # spawn the density it always did rather than fall through to the
    # "unlisted seed" branch below and quietly spawn the whole list.
    #
    # CHECK BEFORE USING THIS FOR REAL: that all four sizes hold the same
    # simulated-time rate, which the [SYNC] line reports every 30 s. "It spawns
    # fine" is not the same measurement as "it runs at real time". If 40 cars
    # runs at 0.5x and 15 at 0.85x, the amount of driving inside each 20 s label
    # window varies with the scenario -- an artefact perfectly correlated with
    # the manipulation, and one that also moves ProVoice's achieved frame rate,
    # which xlstm_model.py already identifies as a leakage channel.

    # of one behaviour.

    # THE 10 HEAVY VEHICLES GET NOTHING, and that is deliberate rather than an
    # omission. "assertive" sets auto_lane_change True, which on a heavy
    # blueprint overrides the baseline's refusal and re-enters finding (3) in
    # the apply pass: van- and truck-sized vehicles sideswiping into the next
    # lane, blocking the road, the rest of the fleet piling in. They are also
    # the vehicles whose corner entry speed the lateral controller gets wrong,
    # which is what the baseline's larger speed penalty is for. Both properties
    # are exactly what a profile written for cars would overwrite.

    # Belt and braces: _resolve_profile's caller now forces auto_lane_change off
    # for heavy blueprints whatever a profile says, and prints when it does. So
    # a profile landing on a heavy vehicle is survivable rather than a wreck --
    # this table just avoids relying on that.

    # CARLA's defaults (10 * 0.01) give a budget of 0.1 s of simulated time per
    # frame. This rig runs the CARLA server, Drive AND the ProVoice perception
    # stack (YOLO26 + MediaPipe + rPPG + EmotiEffLib) on one machine, so frames
    # routinely take longer than that -- and when they do, the substep delta is
    # stretched past 0.01 s. The tire/suspension model is stiff and integrating
    # it at a coarse delta is exactly what produces "took the corner too fast,
    # now it is drifting": the slip solve diverges, not the driving logic.
    #
    # A cap of 24 keeps substeps at or under --substep-delta down to ~4 FPS.

    # CORRECTION, measured on this rig: an earlier version of this comment said
    # the CPU cost was "negligible with 11 vehicles -- rendering is the
    # bottleneck here, not vehicle dynamics". That was a guess and it was wrong.
    # Fitting the achieved rate at two different tick rates (20 Hz target -> ~15
    # Hz, 10 Hz target -> 8 Hz) separates the two costs: about 8 ms per frame of
    # rendering against about 12 ms per physics SUBSTEP. At 100 substeps per
    # simulated second that is roughly 1.2 s of physics for every 1.0 s of
    # simulated time, against 0.17 s of rendering -- physics is ~88% of the bill
    # and rendering is close to noise.
    #
    # Under --sync the substep count per tick is exact and constant, which is
    # what removes the async spin-outs. What it does NOT do is get cheaper at a

    # physics is switched back on. So while the participant drives, NPCs cross

    # toggles that the server executes on its GameThread -- exactly the thread
    # and exactly the kind of actor-state churn that is faulting.

    # Why turning it off is nearly free: it exists to make fleets of HUNDREDS of

    # HAND THE FLEET TO THE TRAFFIC MANAGER
    # =========================

    # WHY THE BASELINE IN _baseline_profile() IS WHAT IT IS. Each of these three
    # numbers is a record of a live drive, so they are kept next to the fleet
    # they shaped rather than next to the function that returns them. Anything in
    # VEHICLE_TM_OVERRIDES is layered on top of them, which means an override is
    # also a decision to leave one of these findings behind -- read the relevant
    # one first.
    #
    # LANE CHANGES: allowed for CARS under --sync, never for the long heavy
    # vehicles, never under the free-running clock.
    #
    # Three findings, each from a live drive, and the split is what satisfies all
    # of them:
    #
    #  1. Async collided because the traffic manager committed to a gap measured
    #     from a world snapshot up to a full frame stale. --sync removes that
    #     cause: the snapshot is exact.
    #  2. Switching them off entirely made the traffic crawl. With no overtaking,
    #     one slow heavy vehicle becomes a permanent rolling roadblock and the
    #     whole fleet queues behind it.
    #  3. Switching them on for EVERYTHING then had the van/truck sized vehicles
    #     sideswiping cars in the next lane and blocking the road, with the rest
    #     of the fleet piling into the wreck.
    #
    # (3) is the decisive one and it is not a staleness problem, so --sync does
    # not help: the traffic manager plans a lane change from a waypoint path
    # without properly accounting for the length of what it is steering, so a
    # long vehicle's tail is still in the old lane when its nose commits to the
    # new one. Short vehicles have the slack to get away with it; a Sprinter or a
    # Fuso does not.
    #
    # Cars keep the ability to overtake, which is what fixes (2) -- and since the
    # heavy vehicles are also the slow ones, they are exactly what the cars now
    # flow around instead of queueing behind.
    #
    # (2) is also the trap in the "cautious" profile, and (3) the trap in setting
    # auto_lane_change True on a heavy vehicle by hand.
    #
    # A FOURTH finding, from a live drive after the per-vehicle profiles went in:
    # the lane changes read as unnatural, and the cause was not this setting but
    # random_left/right_lanechange, which two profiles were setting at 15-30%.
    # Those are unconditional -- evaluated whether or not anything is ahead -- so
    # the fleet changed lanes on empty road as readily as it overtook, and no
    # amount of tuning auto_lane_change could have fixed it. They are now pinned
    # to 0 for the whole fleet in _baseline_profile, and the fleet's only
    # remaining reason to leave its lane is a slower vehicle in front of it,
    # plus keep_right bringing it back afterwards.
    #
    # FOLLOWING DISTANCE: 8 m, independent of the time step. 5 m is under a 0.4 s
    # headway at urban speeds, where real following distances are 1-2 s, so any
    # leader braking became a rear-end hit with or without exact physics. --sync
    # makes the controller's reaction deterministic; it does not give it more
    # room to react in. Overrides that shorten it are re-entering that region.
    #
    # SPEED, and the reason the sign matters: in this API a NEGATIVE percentage
    # means FASTER than the posted limit. The original random.uniform(-10, 10)
    # ran the whole fleet at 90-110% of the limit, while CARLA's own default for
    # traffic-manager vehicles is +30 (i.e. 70%). The NPCs were doing roughly a
    # third more speed than the controller is tuned for, everywhere, including
    # into corners.
    #
    # The values are per-clock, because what they are compensating for is
    # different in each:
    #
    #   async  large penalties. The spin-outs there are an integration failure --
    #          a coarse substep delta under load -- and the only lever this
    #          script has over that is to lower the speeds the solver has to cope
    #          with.
    #   sync   modest penalties. Physics is integrated exactly, so the only thing
    #          left to respect is that the lateral controller picks a corner
    #          entry speed from road geometry without consulting mass or
    #          centre-of-gravity height. Heavy vehicles still get more, but
    #          nothing needs to crawl, and the first --sync run showed that
    #          crawling is exactly how the previous async-tuned numbers felt.
    #
    # This is the one an override most easily gets wrong in a way that only shows
    # up as a wreck on a corner: a per-clock baseline replaced by a single number
    # stops following --sync/--no-sync, and a negative number applied to a heavy
    # vehicle undoes the whole finding.
    #
    # Whichever clock is used for the study, keep these fixed across every
    # participant and both arms, for the same reason --decision-hz and --delta
    # are fixed.

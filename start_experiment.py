"""
Experiment launcher (CARLA + Drive + ProVoice)
Improved version: process-controlled instead of terminal-based
"""

"""
MAIN OPTIONS:
--no-popup: no LoA selection popup
--fixed: fixed starting position
--calibration-only: provoice only on calibration mode, no inference afterwards
--data-collection: don't perform calibration, jump directly to data collection, no inference
--test-drive: don't launch provoice
--webcam: use the external USB webcam instead of the laptop's built-in camera
    (ProVoice uses camera index 1 and refuses to start if nothing is there;
     index 0 is the built-in one)
--test-popup: teaching mode, simulator UI + immediate LoA popups, nothing logged
--remote: CARLA + traffic + Drive (with the LoA popups) run HERE and vehicle
    state is served over HTTP; ProVoice runs on ANOTHER machine and is started
    there by hand, with the command line this launcher prints

LoA POPUP INTERFACE (default = keyboard on every rig, wheel attached or not):
--keyboard-input: the default, stated explicitly -- number keys 0-4 tick a level
    (same key again unticks), N ticks INVALID FRAME instead, ENTER commits
    whatever is ticked (an invalid frame writes no label)
--wheel-input: override -- paddles move the cursor, front button ticks, CONFIRM
    row submits

LoA POPUP FUNCTION:
--functionname: one function for the whole run, one popup per 20 s window
--random-function: function drawn per popup from the five study functions; each
    20 s window then holds TWO popups about two different ones (mutually
    exclusive with --functionname)


EXPERIMENT SETUP:
0. Teaching the LoA control: --test-popup --fullscreen
1. Driver adaptation phase: --test-drive --no-popup --fullscreen
2. Calibration: --fixed --no-popup --calibration-only --fullscreen --participantid
3. Inference: --data-collection --participantid --random-function --fullscreen

EXPERIMENT SETUP (remote):
0. Launch CARLA:
    CARLA MACHINE: ./CarlaUnreal --RenderOffScreen 
1. Driver adaptation phase:
    CARLA MACHINE:    uv run python start_experiment.py --experiment-adaptation
2. Teaching the LoA control:
    CARLA MACHINE:    uv run python start_experiment.py --experiment-popup
3. Calibration:
    CARLA MACHINE:    uv run python start_experiment.py --experiment-calibration-carla-remote --participantid <participantid>
    PROVOICE MACHINE: uv run python start_experiment.py --experiment-calibration-provoice-remote
4. Data collection:
    CARLA MACHINE:    uv run python start_experiment.py --experiment-data-collection-carla-remote --participantid <participantid> --run <1|2>
    PROVOICE MACHINE: uv run python start_experiment.py --experiment-data-collection-provoice-remote

No addresses anywhere: both machines run THIS file, so both take the link
address from CARLA_MACHINE_IP below -- the CARLA side to publish and bind, the
ProVoice side to connect. The participant id is typed once, on the CARLA
machine, and read from the bridge on the other. Off the rig, the ProVoice
presets still accept an explicit address (or PV_BRIDGE_URL). Setup for the link
itself: docs/remote_setup.md.

--participantid is given ONCE, on the CARLA machine: the ProVoice machine reads
it (and the session id) from the bridge, so there is no second place to mistype
it. The ProVoice side needs only the address to read it FROM -- a bare IP, an
IP:PORT or a full URL, or nothing at all if PV_BRIDGE_URL is set in that
shell's environment.

TWO BRIDGES, BOTH ON THE CARLA MACHINE, BOTH STARTED BY --remote
    scripts/vehicle_state_server.py  :8080  CARLA state -> ProVoice (polled)
    scripts/provoice_status_server.py :8081  ProVoice's lifecycle -> Drive
The second one is what makes a split session behave like a single-machine one:
ProVoice posts 'collection_started' at its first logged frame, so Drive holds
its LoA windows until then exactly as it holds them for the first line of a
local raw_data.jsonl, and posts 'provoice_ended' when it exits, on which Drive
stops the car and shows the end-of-session screen. ProVoice is told where to
post through the vehicle bridge's /session, so still nothing is typed twice --
but BOTH inbound ports have to be open on the CARLA machine.

WHAT EACH --experiment- PRESET EXPANDS TO
Presets set flags and nothing else: every one of them is exactly equivalent to
the line beside it, and any flag they do not mention (--webcam, --environment,
--res, --host, ...) can still be added on the same command line.

    --experiment-popup
        = --test-popup --fullscreen
    --experiment-adaptation
        = --test-drive --no-popup --fullscreen
    --experiment-calibration-carla-remote
        = --fixed --remote --no-popup --fullscreen
          --remote-host <CARLA_MACHINE_IP> --remote-bind <CARLA_MACHINE_IP>
          (--remote alone means "ProVoice runs on the other machine, not
           here", so --test-drive would add nothing; --no-popup because the
           baseline drive collects no labels)
    --experiment-data-collection-carla-remote
        = --remote --data-collection --random-function --fullscreen
          --remote-host <CARLA_MACHINE_IP> --remote-bind <CARLA_MACHINE_IP>

    This one also needs --run (1 or 2). The traffic scenario is derived from
    --participantid and --run through TRAFFIC_SEED_PLAN below, so the two
    together are what say which session this is; there is no seed to look up
    or retype. The calibration and adaptation presets take neither -- they
    always run the study scenario.

    Both pin the study link's address, since it is a property of the rig
    rather than of the run: --remote-host is what gets published to the
    ProVoice machine (the automatic guess names the Wi-Fi card instead), and
    --remote-bind keeps the bridges off every other network this machine is
    on. Edit CARLA_MACHINE_IP if the rig is re-addressed; passing either flag
    explicitly still wins for a one-off.

The two ProVoice-machine presets have no equivalent flag spelling, because
that machine runs neither CARLA nor Drive and this launcher previously had no
mode for "ProVoice alone". They start ProVoice and nothing else:

    --experiment-calibration-provoice-remote [URL]
        = ProVoice with --calibration-only --webcam, reading vehicle state from
          <URL>/ and its participant/session ids AND the status-bridge address
          from <URL>/session. Runs the 180 s baseline, stores it under the
          participant id the bridge reports, and exits by itself -- which is
          also what ends the drive on the other machine. Nothing is written to
          raw_data.jsonl.
    --experiment-data-collection-provoice-remote [URL]
        = ProVoice with --data-collection --webcam --data-collection-timeout 900,
          same id handling. Records raw_data.jsonl only: no decision engine, no
          interventions, and the participant's stored baseline is reused rather
          than re-measured. Its first logged frame is what opens the LoA
          windows over there. After 15 minutes it stops itself exactly as
          --calibration-only stops itself when its baseline finishes, which
          posts 'provoice_ended' and makes Drive show the same end-of-session
          screen it shows at the end of calibration -- deferred until any LoA
          prompt on screen at that moment has been answered (or skipped), so
          the cutoff never discards a label mid-window.

    [URL] defaults to PV_BRIDGE_URL and then to CARLA_MACHINE_IP, so on the
    rig neither preset takes an argument at all. Give one to point at a
    different machine, or a full URL for a tunnel. The source that won is
    printed at startup -- worth a glance, since the pinned default is only
    right while both machines are running the same revision of this file.

    Both imply --webcam, i.e. the external driver-facing camera rather than
    this machine's built-in one, and both imply it so the baseline and the
    session it normalizes are measured through the SAME lens. --no-webcam
    cancels it; use that for both phases or neither.

    Neither ProVoice-machine preset starts a bridge of its own: both bridges
    live on the CARLA machine (see above), so this machine needs no inbound
    port and no address beyond the one URL given here.

SPLIT ACROSS TWO MACHINES (--remote): the CARLA machine also prints a full
ProVoice command line for the other machine. The presets above are the short
way in; that printed line is the long way, and still worth pasting when the run
needs a flag the presets do not set (a different --modeltype, --environment,
--w-fcd, ...), since it carries every one of them already filled in.

Either way the session id and the participant id do NOT have to be retyped: the
vehicle-state bridge publishes both at <url>/session and ProVoice adopts them
from the URL it is already given. Supplying them anyway is fine -- ProVoice
checks them against the bridge and REFUSES TO START if they disagree, which is
the whole point: a mistyped participant id is otherwise invisible until the
data is analysed.

# =========================
# TRAFFIC SCENARIO PLAN (data collection)
# =========================
#
# WHICH SCENARIO EACH PARTICIPANT DRIVES, decided once and written down, rather
# than typed per session. The seed is DERIVED from --participantid and --run;
# there is nothing to look up on the morning and nothing to mistype.
#
# That matters more than convenience. The assignment below is a counterbalanced
# design, and a design is only a design if it is actually executed: one row read
# off the wrong line of a notebook produces an unbalanced corpus, and nothing
# downstream can detect it -- the run looks normal, the data looks normal, and
# the imbalance is only ever visible to someone who reconstructs what should
# have happened. Deriving it removes the step where that can go wrong.
#
# THE DESIGN. Four scenarios over twelve participants x two runs. P(4,2) = 12 --
# four choices for run 1 times three remaining for run 2 -- so every participant
# gets a DIFFERENT ORDERED PAIR and every ordered pair occurs exactly once. Each
# scenario is then used six times: three as a first run and three as a second.
# Verified at startup by _validate_traffic_plan().
#
#  - Ordered pairs all distinct means every UNORDERED pair occurs exactly twice,
#    once in each order. So the scenario effect is estimable, not tangled with
#    any one participant, AND separable from the order it was met in -- which
#    the previous ten-participant design (each unordered pair once, in one
#    arbitrary order) could not do.
#  - The 3/3 split across run positions is the counterbalance that matters:
#    run 2 differs from run 1 for everyone -- they have learned the rig, learned
#    the route, and are fifteen minutes more tired. A scenario that always
#    landed in run 1 would have that baked into it inseparably.
#  - Holding out any single scenario removes exactly six runs spread over six
#    different participants, which is an honest generalisation test for the
#    population model rather than a test on one person.
#  - THE ROWS ARE IN BLOCKS OF FOUR (001-004, 005-008, 009-012) and each block
#    is already balanced on its own: within it every scenario appears once as
#    run 1 and once as run 2. Recruitment that stops at four or eight
#    participants therefore still yields a complete counterbalance rather than a
#    broken one -- which is the realistic failure mode, since the design is only
#    balanced at exactly 12 and participants drop out. Run the rows IN ORDER for
#    that to hold. (The three blocks are the "rotate by 1 / by 2 / by 3" shifts
#    of the scenario list, which is what makes them cover the 12 arcs exactly.)
#
# WHY 42 IS ABSENT. It is the calibration/adaptation scenario (STUDY_TRAFFIC_SEED
# above). Keeping it out of collection is what makes the study a test on traffic
# the model has never been trained on.
#
# THE RUN NUMBER IS NOT LOGGED SEPARATELY, and does not need to be: no
# participant sees the same scenario twice (enforced below), so run number is
# recoverable from the participantid and traffic_seed that every raw_data.jsonl
# frame already carries. Note this is a property of the pairs, not of the
# design: it survives dropping to four scenarios only because no row repeats a
# scenario, which _validate_traffic_plan makes fatal.
#
# CHANGING THIS: edit before the first participant, then leave it alone. If
# someone drops out, re-run THEIR row with the replacement rather than adding a
# new one -- a fresh pair would duplicate one ordered pair and leave another
# unused. For a 13th participant onwards, restart the cycle (P13 = P001's pair,
# P14 = P002's, ...) so each block of four keeps the balance growing evenly. A
# pilot or a re-run that should not follow the plan uses an explicit
# --traffic-seed, which is honoured and announced.
#
# The seed VALUES are arbitrary labels -- nothing is derived from the number and
# any four distinct integers would do. They only have to be distinct, stable
# once collection starts, and different from STUDY_TRAFFIC_SEED. What the seed
# selects is a whole scenario, density included: fixed_npc_traffic.py's
# SCENARIO_FLEET_SIZE maps 11/22/44/55 to 40/30/20/15 vehicles, so these four
# are a dose series and their ORDER in COLLECTION_SEEDS is the dose order.
# 33 (25 vehicles) was the fifth and is RETIRED -- the middle rung, dropped
# rather than an endpoint so the 15-40 range is unchanged. It is no longer a
# legal planned scenario (an entry naming it is fatal below), though
# --traffic-seed 33 still runs it off-plan for a pilot.

        ``below_normal`` drops it to BELOW_NORMAL priority on Windows. Used for
        PROVOICE: it shares the machine with the CARLA server and Drive, and its
        perception workers will otherwise take whatever cores the Windows
        scheduler hands them. Starving CARLA's render/physics threads or Drive's
        render loop shows up as dropped frames and input lag for the participant.
        Priority does NOT reduce ProVoice's work, it only settles who yields when
        both want the same core, so it complements the thread caps in
        src/ProVoice/main.py rather than replacing them. No-op off Windows.

        WHICH CLOCK CARLA IS ON depends on ``--sync``, and no code below should
        assume either. Both children are told, together, by this launcher.

        Without ``--sync`` (the default, and how every session up to now has
        run): nobody sets synchronous_mode, fixed_delta_seconds is never set, and
        the simulator advances on its own variable clock. Both Drive and
        fixed_npc_traffic.py sit in wait_for_tick().

        With ``--sync``: fixed_npc_traffic.py owns the clock. It sets
        synchronous_mode plus a fixed --delta step and ticks in a loop paced
        against the wall clock; Drive gets ``--sync --tm-port`` and paces itself
        to that clock with wait_for_tick(), ticking nothing and touching no world
        settings.

        That split is not a stylistic choice. CARLA's traffic manager runs inside
        the client process that created it, so the process that ticks must be the
        process that owns the traffic manager the NPCs are registered to -- here,
        the one that spawns them. src/drive/fixed_npc_traffic.py's module
        docstring has the full mechanism.

        Worth knowing because this docstring has now been wrong in both
        directions. It once claimed synchronous mode when the system was async,
        which sent a debugging session after an imaginary mismatch. The
        correction then hard-coded "async" as a permanent fact, and concluded
        that the sync mismatch had never existed -- but it had: --sync used to
        synchronise Drive's own traffic manager on port 8000, which no NPC is
        registered to, leaving the port-9000 one that drives them unticked. That
        is why every NPC froze, and it is fixed rather than merely documented.
